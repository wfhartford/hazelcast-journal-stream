Hazelcast Map Journal Streaming Test
---
This project is intended to serve as a simple test of Hazelcast's map journal streaming functionality. It is specifically designed to explore the implications of a bug (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13498) which causes event streaming to hang when multiple readers with different predicates are present.
